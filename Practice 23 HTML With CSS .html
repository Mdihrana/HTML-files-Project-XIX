	<h1>Describe College Life</h1>
	<p>Most students like the freedom they have in college.
	Usually college students live on their own, in the dormitory
	or in an apartment. This means they are free to come and go 
	as they like. Their parents canâ€™t tell them when to get up, 
	when to go to school, and when to come home. It also means 
	that they are free to wear what they want. There are no 
	parents to comment about their hair styles or their dirty 
	jeans. Finally, they are free to listen to their favorite 
	music without interference from parents.
